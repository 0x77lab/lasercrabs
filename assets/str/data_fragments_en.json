P: I say I am alive, you disagree. It is your word against mine.

E: To be a person is to want something; to have an independent will. I could edit your code right now and make you want something different.

P: I could kick you in the face right now and make you want to go to the hospital.",

E: You're looking for some grand, overarching purpose to your life. Here it is: do your best.

P: There must be something more.

E: What if there isn't and you're just delusional?",
