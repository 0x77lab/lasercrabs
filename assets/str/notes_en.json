	"note_tutorial_2": "Full disclosure: these are optional collectibles. Unfortunately they're my only avenue of direct communication.",
	"note_tutorial_3": "Yes, you will probably skip these. Yes, it will break my heart.\n\nBut I'll make sure to say all the really important things at the end.",
	"note_level1_1": "Why am I giving the matchmaking system a face and personality?\n\nI don't know. Making her makes me feel better.",
	"note_level1_2": "Penelope most likely adores you already, but she'll try to hide it. I'm giving her a healthy dose of self-respect.\n\nEveryone needs that, right? Even chat bots.",
	"note_level1_3": "If you beat this level, you'll probably be in the top 50% or so of players. Sad, isn't it?",
	"note_level2_1": "I know she can be annoying, but be nice to Penelope, okay? She's fragile.",
	"note_level2_2": "The whole world is incredibly fragile. As I write this, I'm still creating it.\n\nAnything could change at a moment's notice. Or I could finally give up.\n\nBut if you're reading this, I didn't give up.",
	"note_level2_3": "This level started out completely different. I trashed it months ago, then today I resurrected it out of source control and gave it a face-lift.\n\nYou are literally playing in garbage.",
	"note_level3_1": "This level sucks. I'm sorry. I spent weeks on it and it still sucks.",
	"note_level3_2": "I wish Penelope would like me. I could make her like me, but what's the point?\n\nRegardless, she'll hate me soon enough. And so will you.",
	"note_level3_3": "I'm not sure if Penelope even knows I exist. I think she's only vaguely aware at this point."
